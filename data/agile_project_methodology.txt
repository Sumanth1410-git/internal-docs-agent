# Agile Project Management Methodology and Standards

## TechCorp Agile Framework Implementation

### Agile Methodology Overview and Principles

#### Core Agile Values in Practice
**Individuals and Interactions Over Processes and Tools:**
- Cross-functional teams with direct communication channels
- Daily standups and regular face-to-face collaboration
- Empowered teams making decisions close to the work
- Minimal documentation that adds value to development

**Working Software Over Comprehensive Documentation:**
- Functional software delivered every 2-week sprint
- Documentation focused on user stories and acceptance criteria
- Living documentation that evolves with the product
- Automated testing as executable specifications

**Customer Collaboration Over Contract Negotiation:**
- Product owners representing customer needs in daily decisions
- Regular customer feedback and product demonstrations
- Iterative development based on user feedback
- Flexible scope management and priority adjustment

**Responding to Change Over Following a Plan:**
- Sprint planning that accommodates changing priorities
- Retrospectives driving continuous process improvement
- Adaptive planning with quarterly roadmap reviews
- Risk management through early and frequent delivery

### Sprint Planning and Execution Framework

#### Sprint Structure and Timing
**2-Week Sprint Cycle:**
- **Monday**: Sprint planning and story refinement (4 hours)
- **Daily**: Morning standups (15 minutes, 9:30 AM)
- **Wednesday**: Mid-sprint check-in and impediment resolution
- **Friday (Week 2)**: Sprint review and demonstration (2 hours)
- **Friday (Week 2)**: Sprint retrospective and improvement planning (1 hour)

#### Sprint Planning Process
**Pre-Planning Preparation:**
- Product backlog grooming and story point estimation
- Acceptance criteria refinement and definition of done
- Technical spike investigation and architecture decisions
- Capacity planning based on team availability and velocity

**Sprint Planning Meeting Structure:**
1. **Sprint Goal Definition** (30 minutes)
   - Product owner presents business objectives
   - Team discusses technical approach and feasibility
   - Commitment to achievable sprint goal

2. **Backlog Item Selection** (90 minutes)
   - Story point estimation using planning poker
   - Task breakdown and technical discussion
   - Capacity validation against historical velocity

3. **Task Assignment and Commitment** (60 minutes)
   - Individual task ownership and estimation
   - Dependency identification and management
   - Sprint commitment and success criteria agreement

#### Sprint Execution and Daily Management
**Daily Standup Format:**
- What did you accomplish yesterday?
- What will you work on today?
- What impediments or blockers need resolution?
- Are there any dependencies or collaboration needs?

**Sprint Board Management:**
- **Backlog**: Prioritized stories ready for development
- **In Progress**: Active development with WIP limits (max 3 per developer)
- **Code Review**: Peer review and quality assurance
- **Testing**: QA validation and acceptance criteria verification
- **Done**: Completed stories meeting definition of done

### User Story Development and Management

#### User Story Template and Structure
**Standard Story Format:**
"As a [user type], I want [functionality] so that [business value]"

**Acceptance Criteria Framework:**
- Given [initial context or precondition]
- When [action or event occurs]
- Then [expected outcome or result]

**Definition of Done Checklist:**
- [ ] Code meets quality standards and passes automated tests
- [ ] Peer code review completed and approved
- [ ] QA testing completed with all acceptance criteria verified
- [ ] Documentation updated (user guides, API documentation)
- [ ] Security review completed for security-sensitive features
- [ ] Performance impact assessed and within acceptable limits
- [ ] Product owner acceptance and sign-off received

#### Story Estimation and Velocity Planning
**Story Point Scale (Modified Fibonacci):**
- 1 point: Simple change, <2 hours of work
- 2 points: Minor feature, <1 day of work
- 3 points: Standard feature, 1-2 days of work
- 5 points: Complex feature, 3-4 days of work
- 8 points: Major feature, 5-8 days of work
- 13 points: Epic requiring breakdown into smaller stories

**Velocity Tracking and Forecasting:**
- Historical velocity average: 42 story points per sprint (team of 6)
- Velocity trending analysis for capacity planning
- Seasonal adjustments for holidays and vacations
- New team member onboarding impact on velocity

### Quality Assurance and Testing Integration

#### Test-Driven Development (TDD) Practices
**Red-Green-Refactor Cycle:**
1. Write failing test case for new functionality
2. Implement minimal code to make test pass
3. Refactor code while maintaining test coverage
4. Repeat cycle for each new feature or change

**Testing Pyramid Implementation:**
- **Unit Tests**: 70% of total tests, fast execution (<5 minutes)
- **Integration Tests**: 20% of tests, API and service validation
- **End-to-End Tests**: 10% of tests, critical user journey coverage
- **Manual Exploratory Testing**: Ad-hoc testing for user experience validation

#### Continuous Integration and Deployment
**CI/CD Pipeline Stages:**
1. **Code Commit**: Automated triggering on repository changes
2. **Build Stage**: Compilation and dependency resolution
3. **Test Stage**: Automated test suite execution
4. **Quality Gates**: Code coverage and quality metrics validation
5. **Deployment Stage**: Automated deployment to staging environment
6. **Production Release**: Manual approval for production deployment
