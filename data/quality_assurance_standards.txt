# Quality Assurance Standards and Testing Procedures

## QA Framework and Methodology

### Quality Standards Overview

#### Code Quality Metrics
- **Code Coverage**: Minimum 90% test coverage required
- **Cyclomatic Complexity**: Maximum 10 per function/method
- **Technical Debt Ratio**: Maintained below 5% of development time
- **Code Review**: 100% of code changes require peer review
- **Security Scanning**: Automated security vulnerability testing

#### Bug Classification System

**Priority 1 - Critical (Fix within 2 hours)**
- System crashes or complete feature failures
- Security vulnerabilities with immediate risk
- Data loss or corruption issues
- Payment processing failures
- Legal compliance violations

**Priority 2 - High (Fix within 24 hours)**
- Major feature functionality broken
- Performance degradation >50%
- Integration failures with critical systems
- User interface rendering issues
- Data synchronization problems

**Priority 3 - Medium (Fix within 1 week)**
- Minor feature defects
- Cosmetic UI issues
- Performance degradation 10-50%
- Non-critical integrations failing
- Documentation errors

**Priority 4 - Low (Fix in next release)**
- Enhancement requests
- Minor UI improvements
- Performance optimizations
- Refactoring opportunities
- Nice-to-have features

### Testing Strategy and Procedures

#### Unit Testing Standards
- **Framework**: Jest for JavaScript/TypeScript, JUnit for Java
- **Coverage Target**: 95% line coverage, 85% branch coverage
- **Test Organization**: One test file per source file
- **Naming Convention**: describe-it pattern with clear descriptions
- **Mock Strategy**: Mock external dependencies and API calls

#### Integration Testing
- **API Testing**: Postman collections with automated test runs
- **Database Testing**: Test database with realistic data sets
- **Third-party Integration**: Mock services for reliable testing
- **Cross-service Communication**: Contract testing with Pact
- **Performance Testing**: Response time and throughput validation

#### End-to-End Testing
- **Framework**: Cypress for web application testing
- **Test Environment**: Dedicated staging environment
- **User Journey Testing**: Critical business flows automated
- **Cross-browser Testing**: Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge
- **Mobile Testing**: Responsive design validation

#### Performance Testing
- **Load Testing**: JMeter scripts for expected traffic patterns
- **Stress Testing**: Performance under extreme conditions
- **Spike Testing**: Sudden traffic increase scenarios
- **Volume Testing**: Large data set processing capability
- **Endurance Testing**: Extended operation stability

### Release Testing Process

#### Pre-release Checklist
1. **Code Review Completion**: All changes reviewed and approved
2. **Automated Test Suite**: All tests passing in CI/CD pipeline
3. **Security Scan**: No high-severity vulnerabilities detected
4. **Performance Validation**: Response times within SLA limits
5. **Database Migration**: Schema changes tested and validated

#### User Acceptance Testing (UAT)
- **Test Environment**: Production-like environment setup
- **User Scenarios**: Real-world business process validation
- **Stakeholder Sign-off**: Business users approve functionality
- **Documentation Review**: User guides and help documentation
- **Training Material**: Updated training content for new features

#### Production Deployment Validation
- **Smoke Testing**: Basic functionality verification post-deployment
- **Health Checks**: All system components responding correctly
- **Monitoring Validation**: Alerts and dashboards functioning
- **Rollback Plan**: Immediate rollback capability if issues arise
- **Communication**: Deployment status communicated to all stakeholders

### Defect Management Process

#### Bug Reporting Standards
- **Reproduction Steps**: Clear, numbered steps to reproduce issue
- **Environment Details**: Operating system, browser, version information
- **Expected vs Actual**: Clear description of expected behavior
- **Screenshots/Videos**: Visual evidence when applicable
- **Severity Assessment**: Appropriate priority level assignment

#### Bug Triage Process
1. **Initial Assessment**: QA team reviews and categorizes
2. **Developer Assignment**: Based on component expertise
3. **Timeline Estimation**: Effort estimate for resolution
4. **Testing Assignment**: QA resource allocated for verification
5. **Stakeholder Communication**: Updates provided to reporters

#### Resolution and Verification
- **Fix Verification**: Original reporter validates resolution
- **Regression Testing**: Related functionality tested
- **Performance Impact**: Ensure fix doesn't degrade performance
- **Documentation Update**: Knowledge base updated if needed
- **Closure Approval**: Final sign-off from QA lead

### Continuous Improvement

#### Quality Metrics Tracking
- **Defect Density**: Bugs per thousand lines of code
- **Defect Escape Rate**: Production bugs vs. total bugs found
- **Test Effectiveness**: Percentage of bugs found by automated tests
- **Mean Time to Resolution**: Average time from bug report to fix
- **Customer Satisfaction**: Quality-related support ticket trends

#### Process Optimization
- **Monthly QA Reviews**: Team retrospectives and process improvements
- **Tool Evaluation**: Regular assessment of testing tools and frameworks
- **Training Programs**: Ongoing education for QA team members
- **Industry Best Practices**: Adoption of new testing methodologies
- **Automation Expansion**: Increasing automated test coverage
